        <p>Hi, my name is Denah, but a lot of people call me Ned. Ned is what you get when you flip my name backwards (haned) and cut it in half (ned).
            <br>
        Ned is like my alter ego, the life of the party. To call me Ned, youâ€™ll have to level up your friendship with me.</p>

        I have a cat named Kambucha and I love her so much. She lives in my head rent free and is constantly on my mind 24/7.
        Sheâ€™s my pride and joy, every one of my friends knows how much I love her.

        <p>I live in San Francisco for school, but my actual home is in Temecula.
            <br>My birthday is 05/05/2005, so hopefully one day, Iâ€™ll win the lottery on my birthday with these numbers.
        I own a nail account where I make hand painted press on nails called, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ynglenails/">ynglenails!</a>
        <br>I also really like listening to my Spotify, my favorite playlist at the moment is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/77t4ie9ZQE6MO9sZXqHVVi?si=af4403f8b66a4a49">bazinga ðŸ˜µ.</a>
        My favorite color is purple and my favorite finger is my thumb! Specifically my right thumb. I'm currently 19 and I can't drive, BUT,
        I'm actually insane when it comes to Mario Kart.
        <br> I have a huge obsesssion with minions, to the point where I went to Universal Studios with my family and made them all dress up as minions.
        My favorite animal is a capybara and if I could have any kind of Pokemon on my team it would be Blaziken, Lucario, Gardevoir, Garchomp, Goomy, and Hydreigon.
